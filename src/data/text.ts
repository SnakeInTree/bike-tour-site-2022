        para3: "The truth is that long-distance travel by bicycle has been happening ever since the nineteenth century, when the penny-farthing was the height of modern technology. Before pavement connected the disparate sections of our world, intrepid early cyclists ventured to new locales by riding down bone-shaking rustic roads and goat paths. Though the recent trend of outdoor clothing manufactures releasing sleek product lines of ‘bikepacking-ready’ gear is somewhat recent, the practice of strapping a stove and sleeping bag to a bicycle is anything but.", 
        para4: "With this in mind, my decision to quit my job and embark on a ninety-day pedal-powered odyssey across the European continent was not abnormal -- indeed, I was in good company. My journey would take me across the European continent, from the Low Countries, through France and Switzerland, into Italy, and down the states bordering the Adriatic unto my ultimate destination, Greece.",

                "For the car-phobic cyclists among us, there's no better destination than Holland. Nearly every road is coupled with a separate, adjacent cyclepath that near guarantees the safety of cyclists against collisions with motorised vehicles. Better yet, many cycle paths are wide enough to support bidirectional travel by both cyclists and pedestrians.  On warm summer days, these roadways become a pedestrian paradise -- allowing Dutchies of all ages equitable access to their surroundings.",
                "It’s hard not to feel jealous towards the Dutch. The aura, at least on the coastal communities bordering the North Sea, was one of pervasive calm and good nature. Families, complete with squadrons of running, shouting, laughing children, could be found anywhere I turned my head. Sandy white beaches were lined with tidy seafood restaurants and ice-cream stands. In the distance, the striped canopies of paraglider parachutes twisted in the wind, making lazy arcs through the sky. Sipping a coffee on the beach, enjoying the mandatory post-ride cookie, I often found myself thinking, ‘I could get used to this’.",
                "That’s not to say life in the Netherlands is all tulips and windmills. Many of the locals I spoke with talked candidly about the difficulties of living in such a small, densely populated region. Rising property costs and the fear that the coming generations wouldn’t attain the same quality of life as their predecessors was a common refrain, as can be heard in any nation currently experiencing a cost of living crisis. Holland is also in the midst of an ongoing urban-rural conflict, spurred by the fear that Dutch alignment with EU-wide climate goals will put many local farmers out of work. The jury is still out on whether or not Holland will be able to dampen its internal Euroscepticism, and return to the fold.",

During my short time in Belgium, I meandered down the Scheldt River, and explored the historic towns of Bruges, Ghent, and Ypres, before departing for France. Along the way, I ate many crepes and pondered the effects of exporting one’s national culture. ",
            "paragraphs": ["Despite possessing a similar geography, Belgium differs from its northern neighbour by presenting a decidedly less laid-back atmosphere. Maybe it’s because I dipped away from the coast to explore the well-preserved mediaeval architecture of Bruges and Ghent. Perhaps placing Brussels at the heart of the EU has led to a nationwide ‘buttoning-up’, with the goal of presenting a responsible face for a geopolitical giant. ",
            "I don’t mean to be a grouch. But, from the second I crossed the border, my fellow cyclists all changed from comfortable beach clothes and steel cruisers into form-fitting lycra and carbon fibre. I got whiplash. What happened? Was summer gone already, and so soon? ", 
            "I digress. Belgium is, of course, completely lovely. The western province of Flanders where I spent most of my time was bucolic, with a cycle route network that even the most prickly Dutchman would label ‘pretty good’. Bruges and Ghent are gorgeous and absolutely worth a visit. Also, this is the home of the best beer in Europe, which more or less makes up for any of the country’s shortcomings.",
            "Also worth mentioning are the many memorials and museums dedicated to the First World War, which lie strung out across Belgium’s south. Much of the refuse of this century-old conflict is gone now. The cratered landscape around Passchendaele, once shelled to the point where it was said to resemble the surface of the moon, is now a scene of rolling hills and verdant grass. The network of trench lines that once stretched from the North Sea to the Mediterranean has been largely filled in. The most affecting sight was that of the sea of crosses that rose to meet me as I biked up Flanders’ gentle slopes, serving as proof that thousands had taken part in such titanic struggle."]

",

The municipalities left over in the Hauts de France region were bare, often offering little more than a bar and a church to augment a collection of small homes and farmhouses.",
            "The land developed as I picked my way West. Dusty fields gave way to small forests, giving me much-needed cover from the relentless August heat. Relics from history seemed to rise out of the midday haze -- more than once I was surprised by a millenia-old castle or cathedral appearing over the horizon. Once I learned to look a little closer, everywhere I looked I was able to see signs of a culture that had been developing, entrenched, for generations.            ",
            "Northern France was unique in feeling less impacted by the ravages of over-tourism, compared to the rest of France. It was uncommon to find English-speakers in the restaurants, bakeries and campsites I visited, and I cherished the opportunity to break out my pidgin French. Interesting how the struggle to communicate made the simple process of buying bread more of an adventure.  ",
            "My journey paid off in a visit to Mont. Saint Michel, the uber-popular island monastery that captured my imagination from the moment I began to plan this trip. The experience of cycling to this monument can't be overstated. As I rode down the coast, the ramparts rose from the sea and surf, white stone on blue sky, with spires reaching towards black stars.            "]

Gone was the unrelenting force of the midday summer sun, replaced by gentle light drifting down from distant forest canopies. In place of the ruined castles that had seen centuries of combat, the palaces of the Loire Valley stood perfect and diorama like; castles in name only.            ",
                "In short, riding alongside the Loire fulfilled all of the errant fantasies that lodged in my head when I first dreamed of biking through France. Two established bike routes led the way from Mont Saint-Michel to Angers -- the Veloscenic and the Velo Francette, which provided hundreds of kilometres of low-traffic bliss while guiding me through cultural centres like Laval, Angers and Samur.", 
                "Much of the route south is directed by the whims of the Mayenne river, whose languid southerly flow was my constant companion between Domfront and Angers. Life on the river seemed nothing short of idyllic. Each day I passed small groups of fishermen, waded up to their knees and casting their rods into the middle of the brown river. Campers and families on picnic were a common sight as well. Small lochs were manned by teenagers, who, upon catching sight of an approaching pleasure cruiser, would jump into action to clear their path. More than once I treated myself to a beer or iced coffee that was sold by a riverside vendor. After a long day in the saddle. I followed the fishermen's example, and waded into the river, and asked myself how I'd become so fortunate.                ",
                "After reaching the Loire, I took a break from cycling to enjoy the sights with my girlfriend, who came to visit from Canada. Following her departure, I decided I was ready for a change of scenery. Weeks of travelling through picturesque French villages and drinking cheap, delicious wine had begun to atrophy my mind. I needed excitement, and hills, and to be out in nature, and to be pursued by hordes of ravenous mosquitoes. With this goal in mind, I purchased a train ride from Angers to Nancy in Lorraine, and set out to explore the Vosges.                "

My plan was to enjoy a week of gravel riding before arriving, refreshed, at the Swiss border in time for the next leg of my journey in Switzerland.             ",
            "The route through the Vosges ended up being more difficult than I had expected. Perhaps my fitness was suspect at this point. While I am certainly in good shape, a month of lackadaisical riding along mostly flat routes didn’t prepare me for the strain of climbing 1500 metres a day. This being said, the route is absolutely gorgeous, and worth exploring, even if only for a few days. Riders can expect to spend most of the time enjoying some exhilarating gravel climbs and descents, with trips into nearby small towns to rest and refuel every few hours.             ",
            "Personally, I found myself running out of steam about halfway through completing the route. While I could manage the climbing, I could not abide by the deer flies, who can easily keep up with and attack the climbing cyclist. And here I thought being chased by a ravenous cloud of gnats would be motivating! Instead, I said my farewells to the forest and dipped east into the mediaeval city of Colmar.            ", 
        "Regrettably, I didn’t spend much time enjoying the well-preserved city, nor did I stay long in Mulhouse before making a beeline for the Swiss border. My next tour of France will doubtlessly include a return to this region. I won’t leave the TMV unfinished!         "]

This tiny country surprises by being a bit ‘extra’ and providing unique solutions to issues faced by modern nations. ",

It has an intricate web of road cycling, mountain biking, hiking and cross-country skiing trails, and by following the intuitive signs and well-placed map, you can cross between any two areas of the nation while minimising time spent next to cars. You also have a built-in network of wild camping spots. Just follow the nearest hiking route signs to find yourself in pristine, wooded wilderness.",

The French-Speaking regions of Jura and Bern consist largely of bucolic landscapes and rolling green hills that will test even the hardiest of climbers. In-between upward treks, I rolled through hoards of roaming sheep and cattle, and camped in secluded glens nestled within the landscape.            ",

Rare was the farm I saw that wasn't perfectly manicured, with clean fences demarcating the boundaries between different properties, and giving structure to the otherwise wild terrain. It looked as though humans and nature had found some way to co-exist here.            ",

Conquering these peaks was no small feat. There's rarely a stretch of pavement where the grade dips below 6%, and I was either crawling along in my easiest gears, or leaning on the brakes as I descended around dangerously sharp switchbacks.",

Each new corner I rounded showed off a fresh view of the Alps in all their glory, and I never tired of seeing the snow-tipped peaks meet the sky. Back on the ground, my route also took me past a number of charming skiing villages, complete with historic hotels each claiming a slice of alpine history for themselves.",

In the foyer, burry black-and-white photos show squadrons of heavily-bundled hikers standing in knee-deep snow, waiting for their chance to nab a peak.",
            "The small towns atop the mountain range had a sort of mystical, out-of-time quality to them. Maybe I was simply romanticising my journey, or perhaps it was the pervasive fog that gathered in the evenings and early mornings, obscuring my sight and forcing me to slowly crawl along the shrouded cobblestone roads. The quiet nature of that place only made the cultural shift feel more dramatic as I headed south, away from the German-speaking regions of Switzerland and into the Italian-influenced canton of Ticino.",
            "It's in Ticino where the occasionally stiff Swiss culture finally lets its hair down. The laid-back attitude is exemplified by the regional capital of Bellinzona, a medieval town characterised by tight, claustrophobic streets surrounded by a network of defensive castles. I was lucky enough to cycle through on a market day, and relished the opportunity to sample the local pastry craft alongside throngs of socialising locals.        "

Instead of luxuriating on the banks of the famous Lake Como, I found myself dodging cars on tight streets, and pedaling furiously to shorten my stints in claustrophobic tunneled roads.",
            "My enlightenment remained elusive even after departing the land of rental yachts and leased ferraris. Stretching across northern Italy lies the Po River Valley, essential in antiquity for providing arable land and a means of local transport. Today, much of this area (or perhaps just the region I traversed between Milan and Verona), is a barren, industrial landscape, characterized by small towns occasionally poking up from scrubby grass and stands of trees. The dusty visage wasn't helped by the persistent drought that has been ongoing in the area.",

Here, in order to heal my increasingly onerous mood, I sentenced myself to three days of mandatory sightseeing while basing myself out of the tiny lakeside town of Cola. For whatever reason, Garda appeared far less bustling than the western lakes, and I had no issue cycling between my accommodations and various museums and historical sites.",
            "In the interest of perpetuating my good mood, I pointed my wheel north into the mountains, in order to attempt the Veneto Divide gravel biking route. The Venetian Prealps are certainly less famous than the Alps proper and the Dolomites, but the foothills north of Verona certainly provide enough in the way of a challenge for a cyclist looking to climb.",
            "It was riding through the chalky white gravel trails in the Parco della Lessinia that I really began to fall in love with the regions. This natural zone was all rolling hills and stunning views, accompanied by a pervasive sense of calm that I'd been missing ever since leaving Switzerland. The sunset was glorious as I rode alongside miles of preserved trenchline that the Italian and Austrian armies had carved into the exposed rocky earth during the first world war."]

The pervasive decay of the Po River Valley sadly strikes again here, rendering each day in the saddle something of a doldrum. Luckily, the major towns I visited, Vicenza and Padova, made up for the boredom on approach by providing excellent food and lodging.",

I longed for a return to the forests and hills of France and Switzerland, and hoped that Slovenia would offer more excitement. I can't say what drew me south to Venice, but I hatched a plan to ride around the dead-flat Venetian Lagoon by cutting through the southern peninsula of Chioggia. From there, all it took was one missed ferry to strand me on a nearby beach for the night. At daybreak, after fending off a hoard of the lagoon's infamous mosquitos, I decided to venture into the famous city.",

Sure, you'll be in extremely close quarters with tourists of all stripes. And you'll be hard pressed to find a decent meal. But there's almost nowhere else on earth you can take hours of circuitous ferry rides around a floating city, and admire mile after mile of waterside architecture.",
            "I was in something of a stupor while exploring the city, half due to the grandeur and half thanks to breaking camp at 5AM.

My ideal biking conditions are recurring swells and dips -- I like to break out my climbing gears, without feeling like I've entered into a fight to the death with the mountainside. The road between Nova Goriza and the alpine peaks of Triglav National Park exemplified this notion, always keeping me on my toes without making me feel as though I was in over my head.",
            "There were certainly some death climbs to be had though. Most famous is the Vršič Pass, a 5000 ft climb over the Julian Alps that required hours of slow progress up interminable switchbacks. It's lucky that, like the mountain passess of Switzerland, the scenic views are consistently impressive, as are the small roadside cafes offering drinks and danishes.",

Returning to a decidedly urban landscape after spending a week in natural idyll was difficult, but the city bustle had its charm. Chief among them was the chance to do some shopping. By this point in mid-September, the evening temperature was dipping into the low forties, and the pervasive chill forced me to invest in a new hoodie.",

In September 2022, Croatia was still a few months away from entering the Schengen Zone, meaning that leaving Slovenia would require me to cross my first 'hard' border since entering Iceland. Unfortunately, the border officials were a bit too excited by the prospect of entering the Eurozone proper, and cut the power to their station in celebration. Without power, they refused to allow me into the country, instead pointing me to an alternative crossing 30 miles to the North. I arrived in Croatia in the middle of the night, and was overjoyed to find that the host of my pre-booked accommodation had waited for me, and quickly shepherded me into a warm room.",

By this point I had largely abandoned camping, due to dropping fall temperatures and an abundance of affordable, humble lodgings. My spending increased slightly, but I found myself warmed by the conversations I shared with the hoteliers, who were all too happy to chat and discuss life and regional delicacies over an espresso, or, occasionally, a glass of stiff local liquor. I often found myself sad to leave these warm environs, as the wide-open moors of central Croatia offered little protection from the wet mid-September weather.",

The small towns of Gravac and Knin failed to make a strong impression, and I eventually resolved to head south towards the coast in search of more scenic environs.",
            "This was the right call -- south of Split, I joined Route 8, a major roadway that snakes down the Adriatic coastline leading straight into Albania. The views were sublime -- gentle waves and sunsets were my constant companions for the rest of the trip south. This tranquility was probably only possible because it was the shoulder season -- I shudder to think of the traffic produced by the high summer months.",
            "All the same, the Croatian coast seemed to possess a kind of easy calm that the north lacked. I chalk this up to solid road planning. In many countries, major roads are placed right alongside the coast, allowing for impressive development at the cost of disturbing the small towns already stationed on the seaside. Instead, Route 8 rests a few miles off the coastline, and usually is a few hundred metres above sea level. As a result, if you're looking for the beach, all one has to do is hop off the highway, coast down some hills, and throw on your sandals.

Immediately upon entering Montenegro, I was struck by the difference in social characteristics. Everyone wanted to talk -- from the shopkeepers, to the hoteliers, to old men walking down empty streets, with whom I could communicate with only a few words of broken English.
