This being said, I wouldn't reccommend anyone attempting their own European tour follow my route exactly -- I ended up cycling beside more than a few unexpected highways and enduring some hellacious hike-a-bike sessions. Besides, making your own route and figuring out how to get to the places you want to see is the best part or planning!",
