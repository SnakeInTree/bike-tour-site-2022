# Bike Tour Showcase Project

![Header Pic](/util/readMePic.jpg)

In Summer 2022, I went on a solo bicycle tour of Europe. Between August and November, I cycled over 2600 miles (the length of the continental United States!), visited 10 countries and consumed an innumerable number of baguettes.

Now that Iâ€™m back in North America, I needed to make something to commemorate my journey! This Winter 2023, I will be completing the process of creating this React application before making it public somewhere.

Tech Stack:
- NextJS [Framework]
- Redux/Redux Toolkit + React Query [State Management]
- Tailwind [Styling]
- React Leaflet [Mapping]
- ChartJS [Elevation Charts]

All images were captured by my unsteady hands.
